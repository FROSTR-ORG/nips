FROST Signing Device Protocol
-----------------------

`draft` `optional`

This NIP defines a protocol for FROST-based signing devices to communicate and sign events.

FROST allows a user to 'split' their nsec into multiple shares, then distribute these shares to their signing device(s). Each device holds a part of the secret, but no single device has the user's full secret.

A 'threshold' can be set, which determines how many devices must agree to sign a message, in order for a valid signature to be produced.

> For example, a 3/5 signature scheme would split the private key into 5 shares, with 3 shares required to produce a signature. Any combination of 3 shares can produce a valid signature.

FROST also allows a user to 'rotate' their shares, without making any changes to their nsec or npub. Users may rotate shares in order to update their configuration, such as changing the share count and threshold. 

Most importanty, rotating shares allows a user to recover from a security breach (such as a lost or stolen device), simply by replacing the shares  in each device.

Users can rotate their shares as often as they like, without sacrificing their primary identity, or having to use a complex key delegation or revocation scheme.

## FROST Specification

This NIP uses the RFC-9591 implementation of FROST, with additional modifications in order to make the signatures compatible with BIP340 (Taproot). These modifications follow the same conventions as BIP327 (Musig2), which handles BIP340 signing over a schnorr-based multi-signature protocol.

This NIP also uses a special 'domain' tag in order to restrict the signatures produced by this protocol from being valid within other multi-signature protocols.

The domain tag is : `FROST-BIP340-v1`

## Creating and Distributing Shares

When creating a new set of shares, the user needs to provide the following information:

* The number of shares to generate.
* The desired threshold to use.
* An existing nsec to use (optional).
* Additional seeds to use (optional).

Shares are generated using a simple Trusted Dealer method (see RFC-9591 for examples). For inital generation and off-line rotation, the use of Verifiable Secret Sharing (VSS) to verify each share is optional.

#### Share Secrets

To import a share into a signing device, the following information is required:

* The secret key for the share.
* The index number for the share.

TODO: Encoding scheme goes here.

#### Group Information

In addition, information about the share group is also required:

* The group public key (this should match your npub).
* The threshold value for the group.
* A list of public share keys, one for each share.
* A list of public nonce keys, one for each share.

TODO: Encoding scheme goes here.

## Signature Scheme

There are a number of actions that a signing device can take. Each action requires the coordination of (t) number of signers, with (t) being a threshold set by the user.

## Security Considerations

This NIP assumes that all shares are being created and distributed on behalf of a single user, and that less than (t) devices are subject to adversarial control at any given time.

This NIP should *not* be used in scenarios where it can be expected for (t) or more devices to be under the control of an outside party.

#### Recovery / Rotation

The protocol for recovering and updating shares involve reconstructing the underlying secret key (briefly, in memory) in order to simplify the key rotation process for a single user.

While there are safe-guards in place to prevent a rogue device from executing these protocols, the user should still carefully consider *which* device they use when initiating the key rotation process.

#### Nonce Derivation

This NIP uses a key-tweaking scheme for deriving nonce values from a single 'root' key, in order to optimize the signing process between devices (removing the commitment round).

This nonce derivation scheme does not modify the FROST signature scheme, and should still hold against known forgery attacks (such as ROS). However, this has not been formally proven, so be advised.
